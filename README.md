Source data: https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page (February 2021)
Create Airflow DAG and use Pyspark to analyze and answer these questions:
1. How many taxi trips were there on February 15?
2. Longest trip for each day
3. Top 5 Most frequent `dispatching_base_num
4. Top 5 Most common location pairs (PUlocationID and DOlocationID)

Output for each task can be found in the **output_taxi_trip_analysis** folder in .txt format.
